          <h3>Evaluation</h3>
          <p>Assess error handling capabilities, graceful degradation, and resilience to unexpected inputs or tool failures. Patterns like Reflection are crucial for self-healing and maintaining reliability.</p>

          <h3>Pattern-Specific Assessment</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Planning Pattern:</strong> Enhances system robustness by enabling the decomposition of complex tasks into manageable, often independent, sub-tasks. This modularity allows for better error isolation and facilitates graceful degradation in case of partial failures.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Tool Use Pattern:</strong> Increases system robustness by leveraging external, specialized, and often highly robust enterprise systems (such as databases, APIs, or legacy applications). However, it inherently introduces dependencies on the reliability and availability of these external systems.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Reflection Pattern:</strong> Significantly improves the quality and reliability of agent outputs by identifying and correcting errors, biases, or inconsistencies. It acts as an internal quality gate, enhancing the system's overall dependability.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Multi-Agent Pattern:</strong> The distributed architecture inherent in the Multi-Agent Pattern offers built-in redundancy and fail-safe mechanisms. Failures in one agent can often be isolated, preventing cascading system-wide failures and enhancing overall system resilience.</li>
            
            <li><strong>ReAct Pattern:</strong> Its iterative nature allows for dynamic adjustment and potential recovery from intermediate errors or unexpected observations, enhancing resilience for simpler, well-defined tasks.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Plan-and-Execute Pattern:</strong> The explicit planning and execution phases, coupled with opportunities for intermediate result validation, allow for better error detection and dynamic plan adjustment, making it highly robust for complex and critical tasks.</li>

          <p>Consider the ability of patterns to handle increasing workloads and process requests efficiently. Parallelization is key for throughput, while efficient Prompt Chaining and Routing can optimize resource usage.</p>
        </div>

          <h3>Pattern-Specific Assessment</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Planning Pattern:</strong> Directly facilitates parallel execution of sub-tasks, significantly improving overall system throughput and responsiveness for complex operations.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Tool Use Pattern:</strong> The scalability of an agentic system heavily depends on the scalability of the integrated tools and external APIs. If external systems are not designed for high concurrency or throughput, they can become a significant bottleneck.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Reflection Pattern:</strong> Can introduce computational overhead, especially if multiple critique LLMs or extensive validation processes are involved. Requires efficient implementation and potentially asynchronous processing to manage this overhead.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Multi-Agent Pattern:</strong> Highly scalable due to its ability to distribute workload across multiple specialized agents. This allows for independent scaling of agent groups based on demand, optimizing resource allocation.</li>
            
            <li><strong>ReAct Pattern:</strong> Its faster response times for simple, direct tasks make it highly scalable for high-volume, low-complexity interactions, such as those found in customer service chatbots.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Plan-and-Execute Pattern:</strong> Moderate scalability due to the sequential nature of planning and execution phases, though it can be optimized through parallel execution of independent plan steps.</li>

          <h3>Pattern-Specific Assessment</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Planning Pattern:</strong> The planning phase can proactively identify sensitive steps or specific data access requirements, which then informs the implementation of granular access control policies for subsequent execution phases.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Tool Use Pattern:</strong> This is a critical area. Implementing the Tool Use Pattern necessitates stringent API security measures, granular access control for agents to specific tools, robust input/output validation to prevent injection attacks, and secure management of credentials used by agents to access external systems.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Reflection Pattern:</strong> Can be strategically used for compliance checks, identifying potential sensitive data leakage, or ensuring adherence to ethical AI guidelines within agent responses, thus bolstering the system's security posture.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Multi-Agent Pattern:</strong> This pattern introduces complexity in security. It requires secure inter-agent communication protocols, granular access control for each agent's specific tools and data, and robust authentication mechanisms within the agent network to prevent unauthorized interactions.</li>
            
            <li><strong>ReAct Pattern:</strong> The simpler, more direct flow of ReAct might present a smaller attack surface for complex prompt injection compared to multi-step planning patterns. However, prompt injection remains a core security risk that requires mitigation.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Plan-and-Execute Pattern:</strong> The planning phase can incorporate explicit security checkpoints or reviews before execution, potentially enhancing control and oversight over sensitive operations.</li>

            <li><strong>Tool Use Pattern:</strong> Leverages existing enterprise investments in tools and systems, avoiding the need for re-implementation of functionality. However, operational costs are directly tied to external API usage fees and potentially the infrastructure required for tool management.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Reflection Pattern:</strong> Reduces the need for manual review and correction, prevents costly errors in critical outputs, and generally improves the accuracy and trustworthiness of the system, leading to long-term cost savings.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Multi-Agent Pattern:</strong> Optimizes resource utilization through specialization, as agents can be highly efficient within their specific domains. However, the initial setup and orchestration complexity can incur higher development and management costs.</li>
