    <h1>Core Agentic Design Patterns</h1>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Agentic systems are built upon a set of fundamental design patterns that dictate how agents perceive, process information, reason, and act. Understanding these patterns is crucial for designing robust, scalable, and intelligent enterprise applications. This section provides a comprehensive overview of key agentic patterns, integrating foundational concepts with advanced applications and enterprise considerations.</p>

    <h2>General Agentic Workflows</h2>
    <p class="MsoNormal">At their essence, agentic workflows involve:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Perception</b>: Receiving input from the environment.</li>
      <li><b>Reasoning/Planning</b>: Processing information, deciding on the next steps, and formulating a plan.</li>
      <li><b>Action/Tool Use</b>: Executing the plan, often by interacting with external tools or systems.</li>
      <li><b>Reflection/Learning</b>: Evaluating outcomes, identifying errors, and updating internal state or knowledge.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="MsoNormal">These stages often form iterative loops, allowing agents to refine their approach until a goal is achieved or a task is completed.</p>

    <h3>Pattern Details</h3>
    <div class="pattern-details">
      <h4>Prompt Chaining</h4>
      <p>Concept: Connecting multiple LLM prompts in a sequence, where the output of one prompt serves as the input for the next. This allows for breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.</p>
      <p>Application: Ideal for sequential processing, data transformation pipelines, or multi-stage analytical workflows.</p>
      <p>Enterprise Considerations: Simplifies complex workflows, but requires careful management of context, potential for error propagation, and efficient token usage to control costs.</p>

      <h4>Tool Use</h4>
      <p>Concept: Equipping an agent with the ability to interact with external tools, APIs, databases, or other software systems to gather information, perform actions, or validate outputs. Tools extend an agent's capabilities beyond its internal knowledge.</p>
      <p>Application:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Data Retrieval: Querying internal databases or external APIs for real-time information.</li>
        <li>Action Execution: Performing actions like sending emails, updating records in a CRM, or executing code.</li>
        <li>Validation: Using tools to verify facts or calculations.</li>
        <li>Autonomous Workflows: Agents can select and use tools dynamically based on the task at hand.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Enterprise Considerations: Integrates agents into existing IT infrastructure, significantly expanding their utility. Requires robust tool orchestration, security protocols for API access, and effective error handling.</p>

      <h4>Reflection</h4>
      <p>Concept: The ability of an agent to critically evaluate its own outputs, internal state, or performance against a goal, identify discrepancies or errors, and use this insight to improve its subsequent actions or reasoning.</p>
      <p>Application:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Self-Correction: Agents can re-evaluate their answers or plans based on new information or perceived errors.</li>
        <li>Iterative Refinement: Used to improve the quality of generated content or complex plans over multiple iterations.</li>
        <li>ReAct (Reasoning and Acting): A specific application where an agent interleaves reasoning steps (Chain-of-Thought) with acting steps (tool use) and then reflects on the observations to determine the next action. This allows for dynamic problem-solving and error recovery.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Enterprise Considerations: Enhances reliability and accuracy of agent outputs, crucial for critical business processes. Requires clear criteria for self-evaluation and mechanisms for capturing and applying lessons learned.</p>

      <h4>Multi-Agent Pattern</h4>
      <p>Concept: Deploying multiple specialized agents that collaborate to achieve a shared, complex objective. Each agent may have a distinct role, knowledge base, and set of tools.</p>
      <p>Application:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Specialized Expertise: A "research agent" gathers data, a "synthesis agent" analyzes it, and a "reporting agent" formats the findings.</li>
        <li>Collaborative Problem Solving: Agents with different perspectives working together to solve a complex issue, such as design, planning, or negotiation.</li>
        <li>Delegation: A primary agent delegates sub-tasks to specialized subordinate agents.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Enterprise Considerations: Enables the tackling of highly complex problems, leverages specialized capabilities, but requires sophisticated communication protocols, coordination mechanisms, and conflict resolution strategies.</p>

      </div>

      <h4>Planning Pattern</h4>
      <p>Concept: The ability of an agent to formulate a sequence of steps or a strategy to achieve a specific goal, often involving predicting future states and evaluating potential actions.</p>
      <p>Application:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Task Decomposition: Breaking down a high-level goal into smaller, actionable sub-goals.</li>
        <li>Sequencing Actions: Determining the optimal order of operations, especially when tool use is involved.</li>
        <li>Plan-and-Execute: A specific planning strategy where an agent first generates a complete plan, then executes it, potentially reflecting and adjusting the plan mid-execution if needed. This contrasts with ReAct's more interleaved approach.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Enterprise Considerations: Essential for complex, multi-step business processes. Improves efficiency and predictability, but requires robust goal definition and the ability to adapt plans to dynamic real-world conditions.</p>
