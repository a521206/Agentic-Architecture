        <h2>Core Orchestration Strategies</h2>
        <button class="close-button" aria-label="Close details">&times;</button>

      <div class="pattern-content">
        <div class="pattern-description">
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>These foundational strategies are crucial for structuring how individual AI agents interact and contribute to complex, multi-step tasks within an agentic system. They define the basic flow and delegation of responsibilities.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="pattern-characteristics">
          <h3>Sequential Orchestration</h3>
          <p>
            In sequential orchestration, agentic patterns are chained in a predefined order, where the output of one agent or pattern becomes the input for the next. This ensures a logical progression for complex tasks, simulating a step-by-step reasoning process.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Planning Agent:</strong> Initiates the workflow by defining the overall strategy and breaking down the task into sequential steps.</li>
            <li><strong>Tool Use Agents:</strong> Execute specific actions or retrieve information using external tools, feeding their results to the next stage.</li>
            <li><strong>Reflection Agent:</strong> Reviews and refines the outcomes of preceding steps, providing feedback for improvement or triggering re-evaluation.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Dynamic Routing & Specialization</h3>
          <p>
            Dynamic routing enables intelligent, agent-driven distribution of tasks to specialized agents based on real-time analysis of the input or current state. This pattern allows for adaptive and efficient handling of diverse inquiries or sub-problems.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Intake Agent:</strong> Analyzes incoming requests, categorizing them and extracting key information.</li>
            <li><strong>Routing Logic:</strong> An agent-driven mechanism (often an LLM with specific instructions) determines the most appropriate specialized agent or workflow based on the intake analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-Agent Collaboration:</strong> The routed task is handled by a team of agents with specific expertise, fostering specialized problem-solving and potentially parallel execution for sub-tasks.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="pattern-use-cases">
          <h3>Example: Document Processing Pipeline</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Planning agent analyzes document type and requirements</li>
            <li>Extraction agent pulls relevant information</li>
            <li>Validation agent checks data accuracy</li>
            <li>Formatting agent structures the output</li>
            <li>Review agent ensures quality and completeness</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Example: Customer Service System</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Intake agent categorizes customer inquiries</li>
            <li>Routes technical issues to technical support agents</li>
            <li>Routes billing questions to financial agents</li>
            <li>Routes general inquiries to general support agents</li>
            <li>Escalates complex issues to human supervisors</li>

          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>Beyond basic sequencing and routing, these advanced techniques enable agentic systems to exhibit greater resilience, adaptability, and self-improvement by deeply integrating and coordinating various agentic patterns.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="pattern-characteristics">
          <h3>Iterative Refinement</h3>
          <p>
            Iterative refinement patterns involve cycles of execution and self-correction within an agentic system, where agents continuously evaluate their outputs and refine their approach. This drives continuous improvement and higher quality results.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Embedded Reflection:</strong> Agents apply a Reflection pattern at key checkpoints or after each step to critically assess their own work or the system's state.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Quality Assessment:</strong> Agents use internal criteria or external feedback (e.g., from a separate evaluation agent) to gauge the quality and correctness of results.</li>
            <li><strong>Progressive Enhancement:</strong> Based on self-assessment, agents iteratively modify their plans, re-execute tasks, or adjust parameters to progressively improve the output until a desired quality threshold is met.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Hybrid Approaches</h3>
          <p>
            Hybrid approaches combine multiple distinct agentic patterns or orchestration strategies to achieve optimal performance for specific, complex scenarios. This leverages the strengths of different patterns to address multifaceted problems.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>High-Level Strategic Planning:</strong> A master Planning agent may define the overall strategy, while lower-level agents utilize different patterns (e.g., ReAct, Tool Use) for execution.</li>
            <li><strong>Detailed Execution Management:</strong> Blends structured execution (e.g., a predefined sequential pipeline for common cases) with flexible, dynamic problem-solving (e.g., routing to a creative agent for novel issues).</li>
            <li><strong>Integrated Feedback Loops:</strong> Incorporates Reflection and learning mechanisms throughout the system, allowing different patterns to inform and adapt based on collective performance and outcomes.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="pattern-use-cases">
          <h3>Example: Code Review System</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Initial review agent checks basic code quality</li>
            <li>Security agent identifies potential vulnerabilities</li>
            <li>Performance agent suggests optimizations</li>
            <li>Refinement agent iteratively improves suggestions</li>
            <li>Final review agent ensures all improvements are valid</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Example: Project Management System</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Strategic agent sets project goals and milestones</li>
            <li>Resource agent allocates team members and tools</li>
            <li>Progress agent tracks and reports status</li>
            <li>Adaptation agent adjusts plans based on feedback</li>
            <li>Integration agent ensures all components work together</li>

        <div class="pattern-description">
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>Optimizing the performance of orchestrated agentic systems is crucial for efficiency and responsiveness. Parallel processing is a key technique to achieve this.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="pattern-characteristics">
          <h3>Parallel Processing in Agentic Systems</h3>
          <p>
            In agentic systems, parallel processing is a fundamental pattern for executing multiple agent tasks or computations concurrently, significantly enhancing throughput and enabling the scaling of complex workflows and maximizing resource utilization across various agents.
          </p>
          <h4>Key Aspects:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Concurrent Agent Task Execution:</strong> Involves specialized agents working on independent or semi-independent parts of a larger problem simultaneously. This is often achieved through asynchronous operations, allowing agents to initiate long-running tasks (e.g., LLM calls, tool invocations) without blocking, and processing results later.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Coordinated Multi-Agent Operations:</strong> Ensures that concurrently running agents effectively cooperate. This requires robust coordination mechanisms such as shared state management, inter-agent messaging queues, or a supervisor agent to aggregate or synthesize collective results and prevent conflicts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Distributed Resource Utilization:</strong> Achieves high efficiency by distributing computational load across available processors, cores, or even separate machines. This prevents bottlenecks and optimizes the use of distributed computing resources for agent workloads.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Common Approaches:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Agent-Specific Task Parallelism:</strong> Different specialized agents within a workflow execute distinct tasks in parallel. For instance, one agent might be dedicated to data fetching, another to real-time analysis, and a third to report generation, all operating concurrently.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Agent-Driven Data Parallelism:</strong> Multiple instances of the same agent, or different specialized agents, process distinct subsets of data simultaneously. This is highly effective for scaling operations involving large volumes of inputs, such as analyzing numerous documents or handling a high volume of customer inquiries.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Asynchronous Agent Operations:</strong> Agentic frameworks heavily rely on asynchronous programming models. This enables agents to initiate non-blocking operations, such as making external API calls or interacting with large language models, allowing them to continue with other computations while awaiting external responses.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="pattern-use-cases">
          <h3>Example: Data Analysis Pipeline</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Data ingestion agent processes multiple sources simultaneously</li>
            <li>Multiple analysis agents work in parallel on different aspects</li>
            <li>Aggregation agent combines results efficiently</li>
            <li>Visualization agent creates real-time dashboards</li>
            <li>Monitoring agent ensures optimal resource usage</li>
