            <h2>What is Agentic AI?</h2>
            <p>
                Artificial Intelligence is undergoing a revolutionary transformation, with Large Language Models (LLMs) leading the charge in enterprise innovation. 
                Enter "Agentic AI" â€“ a new breed of intelligent systems that can think, plan, and act independently to achieve complex objectives. 
                While traditional AI systems are limited to predefined tasks, agentic AI systems are dynamic, capable of learning from their environment and adapting their strategies in real-time.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, integrating Agentic AI requires a strategic architectural approach. 
                This guide provides a practical framework for operationalizing agentic design patterns, ensuring these advanced capabilities are scalable, secure, and resilient within existing enterprise systems. 
                It's designed to equip architects and developers with the methods to build sophisticated agentic systems, driving innovation and securing a competitive edge.
