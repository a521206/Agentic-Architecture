    <h1>Comparative Analysis and Pattern Interrelationships</h1>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Understanding the nuances and relationships between agentic design patterns is key to effective system architecture. While distinct, these patterns often exhibit synergies and form layered structures within complex agentic systems.</p>

    <div class="pattern-details">
      <h4>Layering and Hierarchy</h4>
      <p>A high-level Planning agent may coordinate Multi-Agent teams, each using Tool Use, Reflection, and Prompt Chaining.</p>

      <h4>Interdependencies</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Tool Use often depends on Planning or Routing.</li>
        <li>Reflection boosts all other patterns.</li>
        <li>Parallelization enhances Prompt Chaining or Multi-Agent workflows.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Distinguishing Core Reasoning</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>ReAct is reactive and interleaves thought and action.</li>
        <li>Plan-and-Execute is structured, with planning upfront and mid-course corrections.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Flexibility vs. Structure</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Routing = flexibility.</li>
        <li>Planning = structure and predictability.</li>
      </ul>
