          <h3>Key Components</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Authentication and Authorization:</strong> Implement granular access control mechanisms, ensuring that agents operate with the principle of least privilege. This means an agent should only have access to the specific tools and data sources absolutely necessary for its assigned tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Privacy and Compliance:</strong> All data handled by agents, especially Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or Protected Health Information (PHI), must adhere to relevant industry regulations and data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). Implement data masking and anonymization techniques where appropriate.</li>
            <li><strong>Threat Modeling:</strong> Proactively identify potential attack vectors specific to agentic systems. This includes risks like prompt injection (where malicious instructions are embedded in user input), data exfiltration through unauthorized tool use, or unintended/malicious agent actions.</li>
            <li><strong>Vulnerability Management:</strong> Regularly audit LLMs, integrated tools, and the agent orchestration framework for known and emerging vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Input/Output Validation:</strong> Rigorously sanitize all inputs provided to agents and validate their outputs to prevent malicious code injection, unintended actions, or the generation of harmful content.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure Credential Management:</strong> Utilize secure vaults and secrets management systems for storing and retrieving API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive access tokens used by agents.</li>

          <h3>Key Components</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Lineage and Quality:</strong> Establish clear data lineage for all information consumed and produced by agents. This ensures traceability and accountability. Implement robust data quality checks to prevent erroneous agent decisions based on flawed data.</li>
            <li><strong>Compliance and Auditability:</strong> Maintain comprehensive audit trails of all agent decisions, actions, and tool usage. These trails are essential for regulatory compliance, internal accountability, and post-incident analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Ethical AI Considerations:</strong> Implement mechanisms for bias detection, fairness assessment, and transparency in agent decision-making processes. Define clear human-in-the-loop protocols for sensitive or high-stakes tasks where human oversight is required.</li>

          <h3>Key Components</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Performance Metrics:</strong> Track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as response times, token consumption, frequency and cost of API calls, and overall task completion rates.</li>
            <li><strong>Error Handling and Logging:</strong> Implement robust error handling mechanisms and ensure comprehensive logging for all agent interactions, tool calls, and decision paths. This provides crucial diagnostic information.</li>
            <li><strong>Agent Behavior Tracking:</strong> Monitor the internal reasoning steps of agents, their tool usage, and any deviations from expected behavior. Implement alerting systems for anomalies that might indicate issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Audit Trails:</strong> Maintain detailed records of all actions performed by agents, especially those involving interactions with external systems or sensitive data, for accountability and forensic analysis.</li>

        <div class="pattern-characteristics">
          <h3>Key Components</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Standardized API Design:</strong> Design clean, well-documented, and secure APIs for agents to interact with both internal and external tools. This promotes interoperability and ease of development.</li>
            <li><strong>Microservices Architecture:</strong> Encapsulate agent functionality within modular microservices. This approach improves isolation, enhances scalability, and allows for independent deployment and management of agent components.</li>
            <li><strong>Legacy System Interoperability:</strong> Develop robust adapters or middleware solutions to enable agents to interact effectively with older, monolithic enterprise systems that may not have modern APIs.</li>
            <li><strong>Agent Tool Management Platform:</strong> Implement a centralized platform for managing tool registration, dynamic loading, access control, and call tracing for all agents. This streamlines tool discovery and governance.</li>
